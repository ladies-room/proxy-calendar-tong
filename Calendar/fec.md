Preparing for Your Conversation
Create a new Google Doc for your FEC Video.

Identify 1 or 2 interesting decisions you made or challenges you encountered

Write several bullet points (up to 10 max), one line each, outlining your answer to the question.
Categorically analyze what is "interesting"
E.g., choices around
component architecture
optimization decisions
your debugging efforts
… and how those decisions morphed under evolutionary pressure.
Additional ideas for conversation centerpieces are listed below.
Possible Conversation Centerpieces
Note: These are only suggestions. Do NOT incorporate them in a wooden, “check off the boxes”, or rote manner. Remember: "conversational" :)

What was your hardest challenge so far? Surely, something didn't work at first.
What was it? Why couldn't you get it to work?
How did I approach any bumps or unexpected delays? What problem-solving techniques did you bring to bear on this?
Tell a "war story" with enough specifics that I, your engineering colleague, can visualize what was happening and understand the root cause.
Why did we choose to use (or not use) technology AB or C?
The choice of state management is a good candidate for this.
There may be other technologies that are specific to your app.
Ideas for technical topics you might consider:
compare Travis v. Circle CI?
compare client-side rendering v. server-side rendering? What did it take to setup/switch from one to the other?
what are privacy & security concerns? what measures did you take?
what kind of optimization did you do?
what kind of best practice would you recommend for this type of development in the future?
would you place limits on the # of files? file size? by module? for the overall page?
what is the most important improvement you could make to your module for user experience at this point?
How did they manage page load speed? or other aspects of the experience of the page load for the user?
Is it a progressive web app?
Did you make it mobile-friendly? using adaptive or responsive design?
